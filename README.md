**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**


SIMPLE WINDOWS UI CONTROLLER, using hand gestures. Currently only swipe left/ right, scroll up/down available, close/open and mouse dragging. Eg swiping photos or scrolling down pdf or IG reels now controled by hand gestures. 

**DISCLAIMER**
Project is NOT finished and is early in test stage - many features do not work fully, eg. mouse dragging is really imprecise and wiggily. Open gesture might trigger some unexpected actions. 
Be carefull with close gesture now - you can close so much you can turn of your PC


**SIMLE tutorial**

for swipe left gesture place your right hand in right hlaf of the screen and start swiping left with your index finger. Analogicly for swipe left.
